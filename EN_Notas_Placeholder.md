"Woods" are usually used for recreational purposes, like hiking or birdwatching, and may be found closer to urban or suburban areas.

To provide clear and consistent instructions for generating tables with specific formatting, follow these steps:

1. Begin with a clear introduction of the task or table you want to create. For example:

   "I would like to create a table that displays verb conjugations in Portuguese for common verbs. The table should include three columns: Present, Past, and Future. Each cell within these columns should contain a complete sentence in Portuguese, its IPA pronunciation, and an English translation. Here's an example of what I'm looking for:"

2. Provide an example or template of the specific format you want. You can use a sample row or cell to illustrate how the information should be structured. For example:

   "| Present | Past | Future |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Eu vou** ao trabalho todos os dias. | **Eu fui** ao museu ontem. | **Eu irei** à praia no próximo fim de semana. |"

3. Clearly specify where each element should go in the table. This includes titles for columns, where IPA pronunciations should be placed, and where English translations should be located.

4. If you need specific examples or phrases to be included, provide them alongside the format you want. Indicate if you want variations for different pronouns or if any additional information is needed.

5. If you have multiple rows with variations or different contexts, organize them in a clear list so it's easy to see how each row should be constructed.

6. If there are any variations or exceptions in the formatting or content for specific cells, explain those clearly.

By following these steps, you can provide clear and detailed instructions, making it easier for me to generate tables or content that match your desired format consistently.
